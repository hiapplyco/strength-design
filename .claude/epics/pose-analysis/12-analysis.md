# Issue #12 Analysis: Video Capture Interface

## Work Stream Breakdown

### Stream A: Core Video Recording Component (blocking)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**: 
- `mobile/components/pose/VideoCaptureComponent.js`
**Scope**: Implement the core video recording interface with camera integration
**Blocking**: This is the foundational component that other streams depend on
**Dependencies**: None
**Estimated Hours**: 8-10 hours

### Stream B: Video Upload Component (parallel)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose  
**Files**:
- `mobile/components/pose/VideoUploadComponent.js`
**Scope**: Create video upload flow from device gallery with format validation
**Dependencies**: None (can work in parallel with recording component)
**Estimated Hours**: 6-8 hours

### Stream C: Main Screen Integration (parallel after A)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**:
- `mobile/screens/PoseAnalysisScreen.js`
**Scope**: Create main pose analysis screen integrating video capture and upload
**Dependencies**: Stream A (needs VideoCaptureComponent interface)
**Estimated Hours**: 4-6 hours

### Stream D: Camera Service Integration (parallel)
**Agent Type**: general-purpose
**Files**:
- `mobile/services/cameraService.js`
**Scope**: Extend camera service for pose analysis specific requirements
**Dependencies**: None (can work independently)
**Estimated Hours**: 2-4 hours

## Execution Strategy

**Phase 1 (Immediate Start)**:
- Stream A: Core Video Recording Component (blocking - start first)
- Stream B: Video Upload Component (parallel)
- Stream D: Camera Service Integration (parallel)

**Phase 2 (After Stream A complete)**:
- Stream C: Main Screen Integration (depends on Stream A interface)

## File Dependencies

**No Conflicts**: All streams work on different files, enabling true parallel development.

**Interfaces Needed**:
- Stream A exports VideoCaptureComponent interface for Stream C
- Stream D provides camera service methods for Stream A

## Coordination Notes

- Stream A should define and document component props/interface early
- Stream D should establish service API before Stream A integration
- Stream C waits for Stream A completion but can prepare screen structure
- All streams should use existing glassmorphism design components
