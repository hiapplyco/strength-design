## Technical Implementation Notes

### Subscription Tiers

#### **Free Tier**
- 3 form analyses per month
- Basic feedback and scores
- Limited historical data (30 days)
- Standard processing priority

#### **Premium Tier** ($9.99/month)
- Unlimited form analyses
- Advanced insights and detailed feedback
- Full historical data and progress tracking
- Achievement system and milestone tracking
- Exercise comparison tools

### Integration Points
- **PoseAnalysisService**: Usage enforcement and tier checking
- **PoseProgressService**: Premium feature access controls
- **Existing Subscription System**: Billing and plan management
- **Navigation**: Upgrade prompts and premium feature access
- **Analytics**: Conversion tracking and A/B testing

### Usage Enforcement Strategy
1. **Service Layer**: Check subscription status before analysis
2. **UI Layer**: Show usage remaining and upgrade prompts
3. **Billing Integration**: Reset quotas on billing cycle
4. **Grace Period**: Allow slight overuse with immediate upgrade prompts
5. **Granular Tracking**: Track usage by feature complexity

## Execution Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Start Stream A (Subscription Service) as core foundation
2. **Phase 2**: Launch Streams B and C in parallel once usage tracking is available
3. **Phase 3**: Integration testing across all subscription tiers
4. **Phase 4**: A/B testing and conversion optimization

## Risk Mitigation

- **User Experience Risk**: Paywalls may frustrate users
  - *Mitigation*: Clear value communication and generous free tier
- **Integration Risk**: Subscription system integration complexity
  - *Mitigation*: Follow existing subscription patterns and thorough testing
- **Conversion Risk**: Users may not upgrade despite limits
  - *Mitigation*: A/B testing framework and compelling value proposition

## Definition of Done

All streams complete and integrated:
- ✅ Subscription service properly extended with pose analysis tiers
- ✅ Usage tracking accurately enforced across billing periods
- ✅ Premium features clearly gated with compelling upgrade messaging
- ✅ Upgrade flow seamlessly integrated with existing billing
- ✅ A/B testing framework ready for conversion optimization
