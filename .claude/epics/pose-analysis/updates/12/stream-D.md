# Stream D: Camera Service Integration

## Scope
Extend camera service for pose analysis specific requirements - can work independently of other components.

## Files
- `mobile/services/cameraService.js`

## Progress
- ✅ **COMPLETED**: Comprehensive camera service implementation
- ✅ Created `mobile/services/cameraService.js` with full pose analysis support
- ✅ Added device capability detection and optimization
- ✅ Implemented exercise-specific camera configurations
- ✅ Added video quality optimization presets for pose analysis
- ✅ Included video validation and gallery upload functionality
- ✅ Added recording session tracking and analytics
- ✅ Provided comprehensive error handling and logging
- ✅ Created utility functions for UI components
- ✅ Documented service API for other streams

## Stream D: COMPLETED ✅

### Key Deliverables Completed:
1. **CameraService Class**: Full service implementation with initialization, permissions, and configuration management
2. **Device Capability Detection**: Automatic detection of device performance and storage constraints
3. **Exercise-Specific Configurations**: Optimized settings for squat, deadlift, bench press, pull-up exercises
4. **Video Quality Presets**: 5 quality levels optimized for different use cases including pose analysis
5. **Video Validation**: Comprehensive validation system for file format, size, duration compliance
6. **Gallery Integration**: Full video upload from device gallery with format validation
7. **Permission Management**: Robust permission handling for camera, microphone, and media library
8. **Analytics & Monitoring**: Recording session tracking and performance metrics
9. **Utility Functions**: Helper functions for file formatting, quality options, and session management
10. **Cross-Platform Support**: Optimized for both iOS and Android with platform-specific adjustments

### Service API for Other Streams:
- `cameraService.initialize()` - Initialize service with device capabilities
- `cameraService.getOptimalVideoConfig(exerciseType)` - Get exercise-specific recording settings
- `cameraService.uploadFromGallery(options)` - Handle video uploads from gallery
- `cameraService.validateVideoFile(uri, metadata)` - Validate videos for pose analysis
- `CameraUtils.*` - Utility functions for formatting and requirements

### Next Steps for Integration:
- Stream A (Video Recording Component) can now use this service for optimized recording
- Stream B (Video Upload Component) can use gallery upload and validation functions
- All streams can use the exercise-specific configurations and quality presets
- Ready for pose analysis pipeline integration
