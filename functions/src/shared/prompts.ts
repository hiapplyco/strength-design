    ${chatContext}PROGRAM STRUCTURE:
    - Total Cycles: ${numberOfCycles}
    - Days per Cycle: ${numberOfDays}
    - Total Training Days: ${numberOfCycles * numberOfDays}

    PARAMETERS:
    ${weatherPrompt ? `- Weather Adaptations: ${weatherPrompt}` : ''}
    ${exerciseList ? `- ${exerciseList}` : ''}
    - Fitness Level: ${fitnessLevel}
    ${prescribedExercises ? `- Required Exercises: ${prescribedExercises}` : ''}
    ${injuries ? `- Injury Considerations: ${injuries}` : ''}

    For each cycle and day, provide a detailed workout program in this exact JSON format:

        "day1": {
          "description": "Focus description for this day",

        // ... repeat for each day in the cycle
      }
      // ... repeat for each cycle

    IMPORTANT RULES:
    1. Create progressive overload across cycles
    2. Vary focus areas across days within each cycle
    3. Maintain exercise technique descriptions
    4. Include specific sets, reps, and rest periods
    5. Format as valid JSON without markdown
    6. Use proper exercise progression
    7. Include clear movement standards
    8. Incorporate insights and preferences from the chat conversation

    Return ONLY the JSON object with no additional text or markdown.`;
