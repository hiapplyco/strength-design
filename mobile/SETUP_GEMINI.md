cd functions
echo "GEMINI_API_KEY=YOUR_API_KEY_HERE" > .env
```

### Step 4: Restart Firebase Emulators

# Kill current emulators (Ctrl+C in that terminal)
# Then restart with your API key:
export GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"
firebase emulators:start --project demo-strength-design
```

## Troubleshooting:

### If you get "API key not valid" error:
1. Make sure you copied the full key
2. Check it starts with `AIza`
3. Ensure you're using a Google AI Studio key (not Firebase key)

3. Look at emulator logs for errors

## For Production Deployment:
```bash
# Set the API key in Firebase (for production)
firebase functions:config:set gemini.api_key="YOUR_API_KEY_HERE"

# Deploy functions
firebase deploy --only functions

# Update your production app to use real Firebase (not emulators)
```
