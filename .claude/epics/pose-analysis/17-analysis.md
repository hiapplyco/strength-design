## Technical Implementation Notes

### Content Architecture
```
Firebase Storage → Tutorial Content → Content Delivery Service
         ↓              ↓                    ↓
Tutorial Videos → Interactive Components → Mobile App
         ↓              ↓                    ↓
Progress Tracking → User Analytics → Improvement Recommendations
```

### Tutorial Content Strategy
- **Exercise Technique**: Professional demonstrations for squat, deadlift, push-up
- **Recording Best Practices**: Lighting, camera angles, framing optimization
- **Common Mistakes**: Exercise-specific error identification and corrections
- **Progressive Learning**: Beginner → Intermediate → Advanced skill levels
- **Contextual Help**: Real-time guidance during recording sessions

### Content Delivery Optimization
- **Progressive Loading**: Load content based on user progress and needs
- **Caching Strategy**: Local storage for frequently accessed tutorials
- **Network Adaptation**: Quality adjustment based on connection speed
- **Offline Support**: Basic tutorials available when offline

### Integration Points
- **Video Capture Interface**: Context-sensitive help during recording
- **Existing Onboarding**: Extended with pose analysis tutorial flow
- **Help Systems**: Integrated with existing app help and support
- **Analytics**: User engagement and tutorial effectiveness tracking

## Execution Strategy

1. **Phase 1**: Start Stream A (Content Management) as foundation for content delivery
2. **Phase 2**: Launch Streams B and C in parallel once content system is available
3. **Phase 3**: Integration testing across all tutorial components
4. **Phase 4**: Content validation and user experience testing

## Risk Mitigation

- **Content Quality Risk**: Professional demonstrations may be resource-intensive
  - *Mitigation*: Start with key exercises and expand progressively
- **Performance Risk**: Large video files may impact app performance
  - *Mitigation*: Optimized content delivery with adaptive quality
- **User Engagement Risk**: Tutorials may be skipped or ignored
  - *Mitigation*: Contextual integration and progressive disclosure
- **Maintenance Risk**: Content updates may be complex
  - *Mitigation*: Modular system design with easy update mechanisms
