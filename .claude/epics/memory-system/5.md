# Task: AI Context Integration

## Description

Enhance existing Gemini AI Functions to accept and utilize memory context for personalized workout recommendations. This involves modifying the current chat system to inject relevant user history and preferences into AI prompts while maintaining the existing conversation flow.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Existing Gemini Functions modified to accept memory context parameter
- [ ] Memory context integrated into AI system prompts for personalization
- [ ] Chat interface shows indicators when memory data influences recommendations
- [ ] AI responses reference specific user history and preferences appropriately
- [ ] Memory integration works with existing conversation history
- [ ] Fallback behavior maintained when memory context is unavailable

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Modify existing `chatWithGemini` and `enhancedChat` Functions
- Integrate memory context into system prompts and conversation context
- Update mobile/web chat interfaces to request memory context
- Implement context prioritization to stay within token limits

**Key Considerations**:
- Preserve existing AI conversation functionality
- Balance memory context with conversation history within token limits
- Ensure memory integration doesn't slow down chat response times
- Maintain user privacy and appropriate data usage

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `functions/src/ai/chatWithGemini.ts` - Core AI chat function
- `functions/src/ai/enhancedChat.ts` - Enhanced AI chat function
- `mobile/screens/ContextAwareGeneratorScreen.js` - Mobile chat interface
- `src/services/aiService.ts` - Web AI service integration
- `functions/src/ai/prompts/` - System prompt templates

## Dependencies

- [ ] Memory Retrieval Service (Task 003) completed and deployed
- [ ] Access to existing Gemini AI integration code
- [ ] Understanding of current AI prompt structure

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: false (requires memory service completion)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] AI Functions successfully integrate memory context
- [ ] Personalized recommendations demonstrate memory utilization
- [ ] Chat response times remain within acceptable limits
- [ ] Memory-driven insights visible in chat interface
- [ ] A/B testing framework ready to measure personalization impact
- [ ] Comprehensive testing of memory-enhanced AI interactions
