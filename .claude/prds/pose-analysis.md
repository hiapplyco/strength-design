## Problem Statement

### What Problem Are We Solving?

**Form Analysis Gap**: Most fitness apps provide workout plans but lack the ability to verify if users are performing exercises correctly, leading to:
- **Injury Risk**: Poor form increases injury likelihood by 40-60%
- **Plateau Frustration**: Incorrect technique limits strength gains and progress
- **Confidence Issues**: Users uncertain about their form avoid challenging exercises
- **Coach Dependency**: Professional form analysis costs $75-150/session
- **Progress Stagnation**: Undetected form issues prevent long-term improvement

### Why Is This Important Now?

1. **Home Fitness Growth**: 73% of users now workout at home without supervision
2. **AI Technology Maturity**: On-device pose detection now achieves 85%+ accuracy
3. **Competitive Differentiation**: Major fitness apps lack comprehensive form analysis
4. **Revenue Opportunity**: Form coaching represents a $2.3B market segment
5. **Platform Readiness**: Our existing AI coaching creates perfect synergy opportunity
