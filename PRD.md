### Shared Code Strategy

```
strength-design/
â”œâ”€â”€ packages/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ shared/
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ types/          # TypeScript interfaces
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ utils/          # Common utilities
â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ constants/      # Shared constants
â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ validators/     # Form validation schemas
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ web/                # Current web app
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mobile/             # New React Native app
```

- Shared API calls should target Firebase from each app; avoid Supabase-specific bindings.

### Development Approach

#### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Clean up existing structure**
   - Remove legacy Supabase references from mobile
   - Ensure shared package exports types/utilities only (or Firebase-friendly helpers)
2. **Set up monorepo**
   - Configure workspace with npm/yarn workspaces
   - Share TypeScript config
   - Set up shared package
3. **Port critical types**
   - User types
   - Workout/Exercise types
   - API response types

#### Code Sharing Examples
```typescript
// packages/shared/types/workout.ts
export interface WorkoutPlan { /* ... */ }

// Mobile/Web usage
import type { WorkoutPlan } from '@strength-design/shared/types';
```

### UI/UX Consistency

#### Design Token Sharing
```typescript
// packages/shared/design/tokens.ts
export const colors = {
  primary: {
    DEFAULT: "#FF6B35",
    light: "#FF8F5A",
    dark: "#E55A2B",
  },
};
// Web: Tailwind config; Mobile: NativeWind config
```

#### Component Parity
- Maintain identical information architecture
- Use same iconography (Lucide/Ionicons for RN)
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Matching animation timings
- Identical form validation
