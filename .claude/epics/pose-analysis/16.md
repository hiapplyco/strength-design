# Task: AI Coaching Enhancement

## Description

Connect form analysis data with the existing Gemini AI coaching system to provide personalized workout recommendations that consider user form strengths, weaknesses, and improvement areas. This integration creates a cohesive coaching experience where AI recommendations adapt based on demonstrated movement competency.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Form analysis data integrated into existing Gemini AI context for workout generation
- [ ] AI references specific form issues and improvements in workout explanations
- [ ] Exercise recommendations adapted based on demonstrated movement competency levels
- [ ] Form-based progression suggestions when technique mastery is achieved
- [ ] Coaching style adaptation based on individual form learning preferences
- [ ] Injury risk assessment integration with exercise recommendations
- [ ] Seamless experience between pose analysis and AI chat interactions

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Extend existing Gemini AI functions to accept form analysis context data
- Create form data summarization for efficient AI context integration
- Implement form-based exercise progression logic
- Design coaching prompts that incorporate pose analysis insights

**Key Considerations**:
- Maintain existing AI coaching quality while adding form context
- Ensure form data integration doesn't exceed AI token limits
- Balance technical analysis with user-friendly coaching language
- Create fallback behavior when form data is limited or unavailable

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `functions/src/ai/enhancedChat.ts` - Extend with form analysis context
- `functions/src/pose/formContextBuilder.js` - Form data summarization for AI
- `mobile/services/aiService.js` - Form-aware AI coaching integration
- `mobile/screens/ContextAwareGeneratorScreen.js` - UI updates for form-aware coaching
- `functions/src/ai/prompts/formCoaching.js` - Form-specific coaching prompts

## Dependencies

- [ ] Analysis Results UI (Task 002) for form data structure
- [ ] Progress Tracking System (Task 003) for historical form context
- [ ] Existing Gemini AI coaching system and infrastructure

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 26-30 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop once analysis results and progress tracking are established)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] AI coaching successfully incorporates form analysis data into recommendations
- [ ] Exercise suggestions reflect user's demonstrated movement competency
- [ ] Form-specific coaching cues provided based on analysis history
- [ ] Progressive exercise unlocking based on form mastery achievements
- [ ] Seamless integration maintains existing AI coaching experience quality
- [ ] Form context integration optimized for AI token efficiency
- [ ] User testing validates improved coaching relevance and value
