# Epic Pose Analysis

> **Note**: This appears to be a clone/fork of the strength-design project. The codebase, package.json, and structure are identical to strength-design.

**Status**: Experimental/Inactive
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

**Development URL**: `http://localhost:5173`

---

## Purpose

This project appears to be an experimental fork of strength-design, potentially intended for:
- Exercise form analysis using computer vision
- Pose detection and correction
- Movement quality assessment
- Real-time form feedback

**Current State**: Codebase is identical to strength-design main project. No unique pose analysis features have been implemented yet.

---

## Tech Stack

Inherited from strength-design:
- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- **AI**: Gemini 2.5 Flash

**Potential additions for pose analysis**:
- MediaPipe or TensorFlow.js for pose detection
- Three.js for 3D visualization
- OpenCV for image processing

---

## Recommendation

**Decision needed**:
1. Delete this project if no longer needed
2. Implement actual pose analysis features using computer vision libraries
3. Merge planned features into strength-design main project
