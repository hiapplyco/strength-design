# Task: Testing and Launch

## Description

Comprehensive testing, user validation, and production deployment of the pose analysis feature. This includes quality assurance across devices and scenarios, user acceptance testing, performance validation, and coordinated launch with marketing campaign to drive user adoption and premium conversions.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Comprehensive test suite covering all pose analysis functionality (90%+ coverage)
- [ ] Cross-device testing validation across iOS and Android platforms
- [ ] User acceptance testing with target personas and feedback integration
- [ ] Performance benchmarking validation under realistic usage scenarios
- [ ] Security and privacy compliance testing for video data handling
- [ ] Beta launch with limited user group for quality validation
- [ ] Production deployment with feature flagging and rollback capabilities
- [ ] Launch campaign coordination and success metrics tracking

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Create comprehensive automated test suite for all pose analysis components
- Implement device testing across various hardware and OS configurations
