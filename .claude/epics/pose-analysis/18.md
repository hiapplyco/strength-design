# Task: Performance Optimization

## Description

Optimize pose analysis processing speed, battery usage, and overall user experience to meet production performance requirements. This includes implementing efficient video processing, background analysis, memory management, and battery optimization strategies while maintaining analysis accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Video analysis completion within 30 seconds for 60-second videos
- [ ] Battery usage optimized to <5% per analysis session
- [ ] Mobile app responsiveness maintained during background video processing
- [ ] Memory usage optimization preventing crashes on older devices
- [ ] Network efficiency for result storage and retrieval operations
- [ ] Performance monitoring and alerting system implementation
- [ ] Frame sampling optimization balancing accuracy with processing speed

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Implement smart frame sampling to reduce processing overhead
- Optimize pose detection pipeline with background processing queues
- Add memory management for large video files and analysis results
- Create performance monitoring dashboard for real-time metrics

**Key Considerations**:
- Balance analysis accuracy with processing speed and battery usage
- Ensure consistent performance across different device capabilities
- Implement graceful degradation for resource-constrained devices
- Monitor real-world performance metrics for continuous optimization

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `mobile/services/poseAnalysisService.js` - Core optimization of analysis pipeline
- `mobile/services/videoProcessing.js` - Video frame extraction and processing optimization
- `mobile/utils/performanceMonitor.js` - Performance tracking and metrics collection
- `mobile/services/backgroundTask.js` - Background processing queue management
- `functions/src/monitoring/posePerformance.js` - Server-side performance tracking

## Dependencies

- [ ] Video Capture Interface (Task 001) for video processing optimization
- [ ] Analysis Results UI (Task 002) for result display performance
- [ ] AI Coaching Enhancement (Task 005) for integrated system performance
- [ ] Existing performance monitoring infrastructure

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 24-28 hours
- Parallel: true (can optimize components as they are completed)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Video analysis meets 30-second processing target for 60-second videos
- [ ] Battery usage optimization validated across different device types
- [ ] Background processing maintains app responsiveness during analysis
- [ ] Memory usage optimized to prevent crashes on minimum spec devices
- [ ] Performance monitoring provides real-time insights into system health
- [ ] Load testing validates performance under concurrent user scenarios
- [ ] User experience testing confirms smooth, responsive analysis workflow
