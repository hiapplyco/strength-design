# Task: Memory Retrieval Service

## Description

Create a Firebase Function that efficiently retrieves and aggregates user memory data for AI context injection. The service will provide fast (<100ms) queries to support real-time AI interactions while implementing intelligent caching and data summarization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Firebase Function `getMemoryContext` created and deployed
- [ ] Sub-100ms query performance for memory retrieval
- [ ] Efficient aggregation of workout history, preferences, and context
- [ ] Caching layer implemented using Firebase Functions memory
- [ ] API supports filtering by date ranges and memory categories
- [ ] Graceful fallback when memory data is limited or unavailable

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Create new Firebase Function with optimized Firestore queries
- Implement in-memory caching for frequently accessed user data
- Use Firestore composite indexes for efficient historical queries
- Design flexible API to support different AI context requirements

**Key Considerations**:
- Minimize Firestore read operations to control costs
- Cache user preferences and recent workout data in function memory
- Support incremental context loading for token limit management
- Implement proper error handling and fallback mechanisms

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `functions/src/memory/getMemoryContext.ts` - New memory retrieval function
- `functions/src/types/memory.ts` - Memory context type definitions
- `firestore.indexes.json` - Database indexes for memory queries
- `functions/package.json` - Function dependencies

## Dependencies

- [ ] Database schema extension (Task 001) completed
- [ ] Firebase Functions deployment environment
- [ ] Firestore composite index creation permissions

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 18-22 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside data capture)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Firebase Function deployed and tested
- [ ] Query performance meets <100ms requirement
- [ ] Caching strategy implemented and validated
- [ ] API documentation created for memory context structure
- [ ] Function monitoring and error alerting configured
- [ ] Integration tests written for memory retrieval scenarios
