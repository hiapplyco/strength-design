# Epic: Pose Analysis

## Overview

Productize the existing Google ML Kit pose detection implementation into a user-facing AI-powered form coaching feature. This epic focuses on creating the UI/UX layer, premium integration, and AI coaching enhancements while leveraging the comprehensive technical foundation already implemented. The goal is to transform the technical capability into a market-leading form analysis product that drives user engagement and premium subscriptions.

## Architecture Decisions

### Leverage Existing Implementation
- **Reuse Core Technology**: Build upon existing Google ML Kit integration and pose analysis algorithms
- **Extend Current Services**: Enhance existing `PoseAnalysisService` with user-facing features
- **Integrate with Firebase**: Use existing Firebase infrastructure for data storage and user management
- **Premium Feature Strategy**: Implement tiered access model using existing subscription system

### User Experience Strategy
- **Mobile-First Approach**: Focus on mobile app implementation where pose detection is most effective
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Start with basic analysis, expand to advanced features
- **AI Integration**: Connect form analysis with existing Gemini AI coaching system
- **Privacy-First Design**: Maintain on-device processing with minimal data collection

### Performance Optimization
- **Background Processing**: Use existing React Native background task capabilities
- **Efficient Storage**: Leverage existing SQLite + Firebase sync architecture
- **Caching Strategy**: Cache analysis results and user progress locally
- **Battery Optimization**: Minimize processing overhead through smart frame sampling

## Technical Approach

### Frontend Components

#### Mobile App Enhancements
- **Video Capture/Upload Flow**: Integrate with existing camera components
- **Analysis Results Screen**: New screen showing form feedback with visual overlays
- **Progress Dashboard**: Extend existing progress tracking with form metrics
- **Premium Paywall**: Integrate with existing subscription management system
- **Tutorial Content**: Educational screens for proper video recording techniques

#### UI Component Strategy
- **Reuse Design System**: Apply existing glassmorphism design language
- **Video Playback**: Implement custom video player with pose landmark overlays
- **Form Scoring Visualization**: Create progress rings and trend charts
- **Feedback Components**: Design clear, actionable form correction displays

### Backend Services

#### Existing Service Extensions
- **PoseAnalysisService**: Already implemented, needs user-facing wrapper
- **Firebase Functions**: Add new functions for form history and progress tracking
- **AI Integration**: Enhance existing Gemini functions with form context
- **Premium Logic**: Implement usage limits and feature gating

#### Data Model Extensions
```typescript
// Extend existing User model
interface UserPoseData {
  formAnalyses: PoseAnalysisResult[];
  formProgress: FormProgressMetrics;
  preferredExercises: ExerciseType[];
  subscriptionTier: 'free' | 'premium' | 'coaching';
}

// New analysis result schema
interface PoseAnalysisResult {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  exerciseType: ExerciseType;
  videoUri: string;
  analysisScore: number;
  feedback: FormFeedback[];
  timestamp: Date;
  processingTimeMs: number;
}
```

### Infrastructure

#### Deployment Strategy
- **Mobile App Updates**: Deploy through existing Expo update mechanism
- **Firebase Functions**: Deploy analysis result storage and retrieval endpoints
- **Content Delivery**: Use existing Firebase Storage for tutorial videos
- **Analytics Integration**: Extend existing analytics with pose analysis events

#### Scaling Considerations
- **Device Processing**: Leverage on-device ML Kit for privacy and performance
- **Result Storage**: Efficient Firestore queries for form history
- **Premium Features**: Rate limiting and usage tracking for subscription tiers
