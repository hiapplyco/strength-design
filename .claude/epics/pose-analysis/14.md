# Task: Progress Tracking System

## Description

Build a comprehensive historical form analysis and improvement visualization system that tracks user progress over time. This system enables users to see their form improvement trends, identify patterns, and celebrate milestones in their technique development across different exercises.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Historical form score trends displayed as interactive charts across time periods
- [ ] Exercise-specific progress tracking for squats, deadlifts, push-ups, etc.
- [ ] Form improvement correlations with strength and performance gains
- [ ] Achievement system with milestones for form mastery (bronze, silver, gold levels)
- [ ] Comparison features showing improvement between analysis sessions
- [ ] Progress sharing capabilities with trainers or workout partners
- [ ] Integration with existing user progress tracking systems

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Extend existing progress tracking infrastructure with pose analysis data
- Create new chart components specifically for form score visualization
- Implement data aggregation for different time periods (week, month, year)
- Build achievement system with gamification elements

**Key Considerations**:
- Integrate seamlessly with existing user progress and workout data
- Provide meaningful insights even for users with limited analysis history
- Design responsive charts that work well on mobile devices
- Handle data privacy and retention according to user preferences

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `mobile/screens/PoseProgressScreen.js` - Form progress dashboard
- `mobile/components/pose/ProgressCharts.js` - Form score trend charts
- `mobile/components/pose/AchievementSystem.js` - Form milestones and achievements
- `mobile/services/poseProgressService.js` - Progress data aggregation and analysis
- `mobile/components/progress/` - Integration with existing progress components

## Dependencies

- [ ] Analysis Results UI (Task 002) for results data structure
- [ ] Existing user progress tracking infrastructure
- [ ] Historical pose analysis data from multiple sessions

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 24-28 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside other features once results UI is complete)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Progress charts display form score trends over time
- [ ] Exercise-specific progress tracking functional across all supported movements
- [ ] Achievement system rewards users for consistent form improvements
- [ ] Comparison tools help users visualize their technique development
- [ ] Integration with existing progress systems maintains data consistency
- [ ] Performance optimized for large datasets of historical analysis
- [ ] User testing confirms progress visualization provides motivation and insights
