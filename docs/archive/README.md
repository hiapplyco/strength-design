### REFACTOR_PLAN_LEGACY.md
**Archived:** 2025-01-17
**Reason:** Superseded by `EPIC_MOBILE_REFACTOR.md` and `MOBILE_DEPLOYMENT_PLAYBOOK.md`

This document described an earlier approach to integrating the `@epic-memory-system` web application into the mobile app. The strategy has since evolved:
- Root mobile app is now at Expo 54 / RN 0.81.5 (matching target state)
- Current approach focuses on consolidating nested repos rather than translating web components
- See `EPIC_MOBILE_REFACTOR.md` for the active consolidation plan
