# Task: Performance Optimization & Indexing

## Description

Implement database indexing, caching strategies, and performance optimizations to ensure memory system queries consistently meet the <100ms requirement for real-time AI interactions. This includes Firestore composite indexes, function-level caching, and query optimization.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Firestore composite indexes created for common memory query patterns
- [ ] Function-level caching implemented for frequently accessed memory data
- [ ] Query optimization reduces Firestore read operations by 50%+
- [ ] Memory retrieval consistently meets <100ms performance target
- [ ] Database query monitoring and alerting implemented
- [ ] Performance testing with simulated user load completed

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Analyze memory query patterns to design optimal Firestore indexes
- Implement multi-level caching (function memory, Redis if needed)
- Optimize aggregation queries to minimize database reads
- Create performance monitoring dashboard and alerts

**Key Considerations**:
- Balance query performance with Firebase cost optimization
- Ensure index strategy scales with user growth
- Implement cache invalidation strategies for data consistency
- Monitor and tune performance under realistic load conditions

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `firestore.indexes.json` - Database index definitions
- `functions/src/memory/caching.ts` - Caching implementation
- `functions/src/memory/queryOptimization.ts` - Query optimization
- `.github/workflows/performance-tests.yml` - Performance testing pipeline
- `functions/src/monitoring/` - Performance monitoring setup

## Dependencies

- [ ] Memory Retrieval Service (Task 003) implementation complete
- [ ] AI Context Integration (Task 004) defining query patterns
- [ ] Memory Summarization Service (Task 005) optimization needs
- [ ] Firebase project permissions for index creation

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: true (optimizes existing services)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All memory queries consistently perform under 100ms
- [ ] Firestore costs optimized through efficient indexing and caching
- [ ] Performance monitoring dashboard operational
- [ ] Load testing validates performance under realistic usage
- [ ] Performance regression testing integrated into CI/CD
- [ ] Documentation created for performance tuning and monitoring
