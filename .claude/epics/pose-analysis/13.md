# Task: Analysis Results UI

## Description

Create a comprehensive form feedback display interface that presents pose analysis results with visual overlays, form scores, and actionable coaching feedback. This UI transforms the raw pose detection data into user-friendly insights that help users understand and improve their exercise form.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Interactive video playback with pose landmark overlays showing detected joints
- [ ] Form score display (0-100) with clear visual indicators and explanations
- [ ] Detailed feedback sections highlighting specific form issues and improvements
- [ ] Movement phase breakdown (eccentric, concentric, pause phases) with timestamps
- [ ] Side-by-side comparison option with ideal form demonstrations
- [ ] Export and sharing capabilities for analysis results
- [ ] Integration with existing glassmorphism design patterns

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Build custom video player component with pose landmark rendering
- Create form scoring visualization using progress rings and charts
- Implement feedback cards with clear action items and corrections
- Design responsive layout that works well on mobile devices

**Key Considerations**:
- Optimize video playback performance with pose overlay rendering
- Present technical analysis data in user-friendly, non-technical language
- Ensure visual feedback is clear and actionable for users of all fitness levels
- Maintain smooth playback while rendering real-time pose landmarks

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `mobile/screens/PoseResultsScreen.js` - Analysis results display screen
- `mobile/components/pose/VideoPlayerWithOverlay.js` - Custom video player
- `mobile/components/pose/FormScoreDisplay.js` - Form scoring visualization
- `mobile/components/pose/FeedbackCards.js` - Form feedback components
- `mobile/components/charts/` - Progress and scoring chart components

## Dependencies

- [ ] Video Capture Interface (Task 001) for video data input
- [ ] Existing PoseAnalysisService integration for analysis data
- [ ] Existing chart and visualization components

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 28-32 hours
- Parallel: false (requires video capture functionality)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Video playback with pose landmark overlays functional
- [ ] Form scoring visualization clearly shows user performance
- [ ] Feedback sections provide actionable coaching insights
- [ ] Movement phase analysis helps users understand exercise execution
- [ ] Comparison tools enable learning from ideal form examples
- [ ] UI performance optimized for smooth video playback with overlays
- [ ] User testing validates clarity and usefulness of feedback presentation
