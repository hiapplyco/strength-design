## Tips for Effective Testing

### Do's ✅
- **Be honest**: We want real feedback, not sugar-coated
- **Be specific**: "The button was hard to find" is more helpful than "bad UX"
- **Use your own device**: Test in real-world conditions
- **Test at different times**: Morning, evening, at gym, at home
- **Take screenshots**: Capture bugs or confusing moments
- **Ask questions**: Use the Slack/Discord channel

### Don'ts ❌
- Don't rush through scenarios - take your time
- Don't skip feedback forms - they're crucial
- Don't test only perfect scenarios - try to break things
- Don't worry about "looking bad" on camera - this is about form analysis, not appearance

### Recording Tips 📹
- Ensure good lighting (face a window or light source)
- Show your full body in frame (head to toe)
- Use a phone stand or prop against a wall
- Record from the side for squat/deadlift
- Record from above for pushups (place phone on floor)
