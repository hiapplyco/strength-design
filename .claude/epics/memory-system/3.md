# Task: Memory Data Capture Implementation

## Description

Modify existing workout tracking screens and flows to automatically capture memory-related data during workout sessions. This includes performance metrics (RPE, duration, completion rate) and contextual information (location, time of day, energy level) without disrupting the current user experience.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Active workout tracking captures RPE, duration, and completion rate automatically
- [ ] Contextual data collection added to workout start flow (location, energy level)
- [ ] User preference data captured during goal setting and equipment selection
- [ ] Memory data sync implemented between mobile SQLite and Firestore
- [ ] Data capture works offline and syncs when connection restored
- [ ] No impact on existing workout tracking performance

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Extend existing workout tracking components to capture additional data
- Add optional contextual prompts to workout initiation flow
- Implement automatic calculation of performance metrics
- Update sync service to handle memory data fields

**Key Considerations**:
- Keep user experience seamless - avoid excessive prompts
- Implement smart defaults for contextual data when possible
- Ensure data capture doesn't slow down workout flows
- Handle edge cases for incomplete workouts

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `mobile/screens/WorkoutsScreen.js` - Workout tracking interface
- `mobile/services/workoutService.js` - Workout data processing
- `mobile/services/syncService.js` - Data synchronization
- `mobile/components/workout/` - Workout tracking components
- `src/services/workoutService.ts` - Web workout service

## Dependencies

- [ ] Database schema extension (Task 001) completed
- [ ] Access to existing workout tracking codebase
- [ ] Mobile development environment setup

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 24-28 hours
- Parallel: false (conflicts with memory retrieval service development)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Memory data captured automatically during workouts
- [ ] Contextual prompts integrated into workout flows
- [ ] Data sync working between local and Firebase
- [ ] Offline capture and sync functionality tested
- [ ] Performance benchmarks maintained for workout tracking
- [ ] User acceptance testing completed for new capture flows
