# Task: Memory Summarization Service

## Description

Implement intelligent memory summarization to keep AI context within Gemini token limits while preserving the most relevant user information. This service will create concise summaries of workout history, identify key patterns, and prioritize recent or significant data for AI context injection.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory summarization algorithm implemented for workout history
- [ ] Pattern recognition for user preferences and behavior trends
- [ ] Dynamic context prioritization based on conversation topic
- [ ] Token-aware summarization that fits within Gemini limits
- [ ] Summary freshness management with automatic updates
- [ ] Performance optimization for real-time summarization

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Create summarization algorithms for different memory types
- Implement sliding window approach for recent vs. historical data
- Use statistical analysis to identify workout patterns and preferences
- Design context templates optimized for AI consumption

**Key Considerations**:
- Balance comprehensiveness with token efficiency
- Preserve critical information while reducing data volume
- Update summaries incrementally to avoid reprocessing all data
- Consider conversation context when selecting relevant memories

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `functions/src/memory/summarizationService.ts` - Core summarization logic
- `functions/src/memory/patternAnalysis.ts` - Pattern recognition algorithms
- `functions/src/memory/contextBuilder.ts` - AI context construction
- `functions/src/types/memorySummary.ts` - Summary type definitions

## Dependencies

- [ ] Memory Retrieval Service (Task 003) providing raw memory data
- [ ] Understanding of Gemini token limits and context structure
- [ ] Access to existing workout and user data patterns

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop alongside AI integration)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Summarization algorithms tested with real user data
- [ ] Token limits respected while maintaining memory relevance
- [ ] Pattern recognition accurately identifies user preferences
- [ ] Summarization performance meets real-time requirements
- [ ] A/B testing shows improved AI personalization with summaries
- [ ] Documentation created for summarization strategy and maintenance
