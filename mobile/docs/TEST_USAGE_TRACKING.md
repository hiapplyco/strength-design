## Summary of Changes

✅ **All requested changes have been implemented successfully:**

### 1. Removed Fake Stats from ExerciseDetailModal.js

### 4. Last Used Tracking

- ✅ Automatically marks exercise as used when modal is opened

## Testing Instructions

### Manual Testing:
1. **Open an exercise** - Modal should show "Never used" initially
2. **Close and reopen** - Should show "Last used: Just used"
3. **Use navigation arrows** - Should navigate between exercises
4. **Check exercise cards** - Should display last used status
5. **Wait and reopen** - Should show accurate time elapsed

### Programmatic Testing:
```javascript
// Test the utility functions
import { markExerciseAsUsed, getFormattedLastUsed } from './utils/exerciseUsageTracker';

// Mark an exercise as used
markExerciseAsUsed('test-exercise-1');

// Check the formatted output
console.log(getFormattedLastUsed('test-exercise-1')); // "Last used: Just used"
console.log(getFormattedLastUsed('nonexistent-exercise')); // "Never used"
```

## Time Format Examples
- **Immediate**: "Just used"
- **Minutes**: "5 minutes ago"
- **Hours**: "2 hours ago" 
- **Yesterday**: "Yesterday"
- **Days**: "3 days ago"
- **Weeks**: "2 weeks ago"
- **Months**: "3 months ago"
- **Long ago**: "Over a year ago"
- **Never**: "Never used"

## Implementation Notes
- ✅ All localStorage operations include error handling
- ✅ Navigation arrows have proper disabled states
- ✅ Usage tracking is automatic (marks as used when modal opens)
- ✅ Time formatting is human-friendly and intuitive
- ✅ Exercise cards maintain existing functionality while adding usage info
- ✅ Modal maintains backward compatibility with existing props

## Ready for Use
The implementation is complete and ready for testing. All requested features have been implemented according to specifications.
