# Task: Progress Visualization Enhancement

## Description

Extend existing progress screens with historical trend analysis, workout progression charts, and memory-driven insights. This enhancement will leverage the captured memory data to provide users with meaningful visualizations of their fitness journey and progress patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Workout progression charts showing strength gains over time
- [ ] Performance trend analysis (completion rates, RPE patterns, duration trends)
- [ ] Equipment usage and preference visualization
- [ ] Goal achievement tracking with historical context
- [ ] Comparative analysis across different time periods
- [ ] Integration with existing health data visualization

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Extend existing progress components with memory data integration
- Create chart components for workout progression and trends
- Implement data aggregation for different time periods and metrics
- Design responsive visualizations for mobile and web platforms

**Key Considerations**:
- Maintain performance with large datasets through data pagination
- Provide meaningful insights even for users with limited history
- Ensure visualizations are accessible and easy to understand
- Handle edge cases for incomplete or irregular workout data

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `mobile/screens/ProgressScreen.js` - Mobile progress visualization
- `src/components/progress/` - Web progress components
- `mobile/components/charts/` - Mobile chart components
- `src/services/progressService.ts` - Progress data processing
- `mobile/services/progressService.js` - Mobile progress service

## Dependencies

- [ ] Memory data capture (Task 002) providing historical workout data
- [ ] Memory retrieval service (Task 003) for progress data aggregation
- [ ] Access to existing progress tracking components

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 18-22 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop after data capture is complete)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Enhanced progress screens deployed to mobile and web
- [ ] Chart performance tested with large workout history datasets
- [ ] User testing validates usefulness of new visualizations
- [ ] Progress insights help users understand their fitness journey
- [ ] Integration seamless with existing health data displays
- [ ] Accessibility standards met for all new visualization components
