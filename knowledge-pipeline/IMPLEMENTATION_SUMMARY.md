## 🎯 Integration Points

### Firebase Functions
All knowledge functions are integrated into the existing Firebase Functions setup:
```typescript
// functions/src/index.ts
export * from "./knowledge";  // ✅ Added

// Available functions:
// - ingestKnowledge
// - searchKnowledge  
// - processKnowledgeContent
// - getKnowledgeStats
// - updateKnowledgeIndex
```

### Mobile App
Knowledge service is ready for immediate use:
```javascript
import { knowledgeService } from '../services/KnowledgeService';

// Search fitness content
const results = await knowledgeService.searchKnowledge({
  query: 'deadlift form',
  filters: { content_type: ['exercise', 'guide'] },
  limit: 20
});

// Get high-quality content
const topContent = await knowledgeService.getHighQualityKnowledge(10);
```

### Firestore Schema
```javascript
// Collection: knowledge
{
  id: "reddit_abc123",
  source: "reddit",
  title: "Perfect Deadlift Form Guide", 
  content: "Full content text...",
  content_type: "guide",
  quality_score: 0.85,
  tags: ["deadlift", "form", "technique"],
  search_keywords: ["deadlift", "form", "guide"],
  created_at: Timestamp,
  processed_at: Timestamp,
  // AI enhancements
  ai_summary: "Concise summary...",
  key_takeaways: ["Keep back straight", "..."],
  ai_categories: ["strength", "powerlifting"],
  // Metadata
  metadata: { subreddit: "weightroom", score: 150 }
}
```
