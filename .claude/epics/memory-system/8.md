# Task: Preference Management Interface

## Description

Add memory-specific settings and preference management to existing user settings screens. This interface will allow users to review, modify, and control their memory data including equipment preferences, workout styles, communication preferences, and privacy settings for memory usage.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Memory preferences section added to existing settings screens
- [ ] Equipment preference management with add/remove functionality
- [ ] Workout style and goal preference configuration
- [ ] AI communication style preferences (detailed vs. concise)
- [ ] Memory data privacy controls and opt-out options
- [ ] Preference changes immediately affect AI recommendations

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Extend existing user settings components with memory preference sections
- Create reusable preference management components
- Implement real-time preference updates with Firebase sync
- Design intuitive interface for complex preference structures

**Key Considerations**:
- Maintain consistency with existing settings UI patterns
- Provide clear explanations for how preferences affect AI behavior
- Implement proper validation for preference combinations
- Ensure preference changes sync across mobile and web platforms

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `mobile/screens/SettingsScreen.js` - Mobile settings interface
- `src/components/settings/` - Web settings components

- `mobile/services/userService.js` - Mobile user service

## Dependencies

- [ ] Memory data capture (Task 002) defining preference structure
- [ ] Understanding of existing settings UI patterns
- [ ] User preference data model from database schema

## Effort Estimate

- Size: S
- Hours: 12-16 hours
- Parallel: true (can develop after data model is established)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Preference management UI integrated into settings screens
- [ ] All memory preferences configurable through interface
- [ ] Preference changes sync in real-time across platforms
- [ ] User testing confirms interface usability and clarity
- [ ] Privacy controls meet data protection requirements
