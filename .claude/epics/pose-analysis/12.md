# Task: Video Capture Interface

## Description

Implement an intuitive video recording and upload interface that guides users through proper video capture for pose analysis. This foundational UI component enables users to record or select videos with appropriate camera angles, lighting conditions, and exercise framing for optimal pose detection accuracy.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Video recording interface integrated with existing camera components
- [ ] Support for video upload from device gallery (MP4, MOV formats up to 2GB)
- [ ] Real-time guidance overlay showing proper camera positioning and framing
- [ ] Exercise type selection before video capture for analysis preparation
- [ ] Video preview and re-record functionality before analysis submission
- [ ] Proper error handling for camera permissions and storage issues
- [ ] Integration with existing app navigation and glassmorphism design system

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Extend existing camera components from Strength.Design mobile app
- Implement video recording with exercise-specific framing guidelines
- Create upload flow using device media library integration
- Add real-time overlay graphics showing optimal positioning

**Key Considerations**:
- Maintain existing glassmorphism UI design consistency
- Optimize for both portrait and landscape video recording
- Handle device permissions gracefully with clear user messaging
- Ensure video quality settings balance file size with analysis accuracy

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `mobile/screens/PoseAnalysisScreen.js` - New main pose analysis screen
- `mobile/components/pose/VideoCaptureComponent.js` - Video recording interface
- `mobile/components/pose/VideoUploadComponent.js` - Video upload flow
- `mobile/services/cameraService.js` - Camera and media library integration
- `mobile/components/ui/` - Reuse existing glassmorphism components

## Dependencies

- [ ] Access to existing mobile app camera components and services
- [ ] Device camera and media library permissions
- [ ] Existing UI component library and design system

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 20-24 hours
- Parallel: false (foundational component for other tasks)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Video recording interface implemented and functional
- [ ] Video upload from gallery working with proper format validation
- [ ] User guidance overlays provide clear positioning instructions
- [ ] Error handling implemented for common failure scenarios
- [ ] Integration tested with existing app navigation
- [ ] UI components follow existing design system patterns
- [ ] Cross-platform compatibility verified on iOS and Android
