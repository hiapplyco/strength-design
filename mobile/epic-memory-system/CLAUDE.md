# Epic Memory System

> **Note**: This appears to be a clone/fork of the strength-design project. The codebase, package.json, and structure are identical to strength-design.

**Status**: Experimental/Inactive
**Last Updated**: 2025-09-30

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run development server
npm run dev

# Build for production
npm run build
```

**Development URL**: `http://localhost:5173`

## Purpose

This project appears to be an experimental fork of strength-design, potentially intended for:
- Memory/history tracking features for workouts
- Long-term progress analysis
- Historical data visualization

**Current State**: Codebase is identical to strength-design main project. No unique features have been implemented yet.

## Tech Stack

Inherited from strength-design:
- **Framework**: React 18 + TypeScript + Vite
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui
- **Backend**: Firebase (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions)
- **AI**: Gemini 2.5 Flash

## Recommendation

**Decision needed**:
1. Delete this project if no longer needed
2. Differentiate it from strength-design with specific features
3. Merge back into strength-design if this was experimental
