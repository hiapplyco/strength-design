# Task: Database Schema Extension

## Description

Extend existing Firestore collections and mobile SQLite schema to include memory-related fields. This foundational task enables the capture and storage of workout history, user preferences, and contextual information without creating new database structures.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Firestore `users` collection extended with UserMemory fields (preferences, limitations)
- [ ] Firestore `workoutSessions` collection extended with WorkoutMemory fields (performance, context)
- [ ] Mobile SQLite schema updated with corresponding memory tables/columns
- [ ] Database migrations created for existing users
- [ ] Firestore security rules updated to allow memory field access
- [ ] All existing functionality remains unaffected

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Extend existing TypeScript interfaces for User and WorkoutSession models
- Create Firestore schema migration scripts
- Update mobile SQLite database schema files
- Implement backward compatibility for existing data

**Key Considerations**:
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing user data
- Ensure new fields are optional to avoid breaking changes
- Consider data migration strategy for existing workout sessions

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `src/types/user.ts` - User model extensions
- `src/types/workout.ts` - WorkoutSession model extensions  
- `mobile/services/database.js` - SQLite schema updates
- `firestore.rules` - Security rule updates
- `functions/src/types/` - Shared type definitions

## Dependencies

- [ ] Firebase project access with schema modification permissions
- [ ] Mobile development environment for SQLite testing
- [ ] Existing user and workout type definitions

## Effort Estimate

- Size: M
- Hours: 16-20 hours
- Parallel: false (blocks other development)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Code implemented with proper TypeScript types
- [ ] Database migrations tested with existing data
- [ ] Security rules validate memory field access
- [ ] Mobile SQLite schema updated and tested
- [ ] No regressions in existing user/workout functionality
- [ ] Documentation updated for new schema fields
