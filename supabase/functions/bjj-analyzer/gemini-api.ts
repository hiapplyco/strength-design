Analyze this video and address the following question: ${query}

Please provide a comprehensive analysis with the following structure:

## SKILL ASSESSMENT
Categorize the practitioner's level (beginner, intermediate, advanced, elite) based on movement quality, technical precision, and understanding of fundamentals.

## KEY STRENGTHS (2-3 points)
• Identify technically sound elements
• Explain why these demonstrate good technique
• Note timing and execution quality

## CRITICAL IMPROVEMENTS (2-3 points)
• Pinpoint the highest-leverage technical corrections needed
• Explain the biomechanical principles involved
• Describe potential performance consequences if not addressed

## SPECIFIC DRILLS & PROGRESSIONS
• Prescribe 1-2 targeted exercises that address identified weaknesses
• Explain the correct sensation/feeling to develop
• Provide progression steps for skill development

## COACHING INSIGHT
One key conceptual understanding that would elevate their performance significantly.

## ACTIONABLE TAKEAWAY
A memorable principle or cue they should focus on in their next training session.

Keep your analysis under 500 words while being specific and actionable. Focus on the most impactful improvements.${timestampInstructions}`
