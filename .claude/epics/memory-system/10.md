# Task: Testing & Validation Suite

## Description

Create comprehensive testing suite for the memory system including unit tests, integration tests, performance tests, and AI personalization validation. This ensures memory system accuracy, performance, and effectiveness in improving AI recommendations while maintaining system reliability.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for all memory services and data models (90%+ coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests for memory data capture and retrieval flows
- [ ] Performance tests validating <100ms query requirements
- [ ] AI personalization A/B testing framework implemented
- [ ] Memory data privacy and security compliance testing
- [ ] End-to-end testing covering complete user memory journey

## Technical Details

**Implementation Approach**:
- Create unit tests for memory services, summarization, and context building
- Implement integration tests using Firebase emulators
- Build performance test suite with realistic data volumes
- Create A/B testing framework to measure AI personalization improvements

**Key Considerations**:
- Test with realistic user data volumes and patterns
- Validate memory system works correctly with limited historical data
- Ensure tests cover edge cases and error scenarios
- Create repeatable testing environments for consistent results

**Code Locations/Files Affected**:
- `functions/src/__tests__/memory/` - Memory service unit tests
- `mobile/__tests__/services/` - Mobile service integration tests
- `src/__tests__/services/` - Web service unit tests
- `.github/workflows/memory-tests.yml` - CI/CD test pipeline
- `functions/src/testing/` - Testing utilities and fixtures

## Dependencies

- [ ] All previous memory system tasks completed
- [ ] Testing infrastructure and Firebase emulators configured
- [ ] Access to representative user data for test scenarios

## Effort Estimate

- Size: L
- Hours: 24-28 hours
- Parallel: false (requires all system components completed)

## Definition of Done

- [ ] Comprehensive test suite with 90%+ code coverage
- [ ] All tests passing in CI/CD pipeline
- [ ] Performance benchmarks validated under load
- [ ] A/B testing shows measurable improvement in AI personalization
- [ ] Security and privacy compliance verified through testing
- [ ] Documentation created for testing procedures and maintenance
