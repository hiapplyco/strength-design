â”‚   â””â”€â”€ mobile/             # New React Native app
```

### Development Approach

#### Immediate Actions (Week 1)
1. **Clean up existing structure**
   - Remove empty `/apps/mobile` directory
   - Move `/apps/mobile-fresh` to `/packages/mobile`
   - Initialize proper Expo project

2. **Set up monorepo**
   - Configure workspace with npm/yarn workspaces
   - Share TypeScript config
   - Set up shared package

3. **Port critical types**
   - User types
   - Workout/Exercise types
   - API response types
   - Supabase generated types

#### Code Sharing Examples
```typescript
// packages/shared/api/workouts.ts
export const workoutQueries = {
  getWorkouts: (userId: string) => ({
    queryKey: ['workouts', userId],
    queryFn: () => supabase
      .from('workouts')
      .select('*')
      .eq('user_id', userId)
  }),
  
  createWorkout: async (workout: WorkoutInput) => {
    const { data, error } = await supabase
      .from('workouts')
      .insert(workout)
      .select()
      .single();
    
    if (error) throw error;
    return data;
  }
};

// Used in both web and mobile:
// packages/web/src/hooks/useWorkouts.ts
// packages/mobile/src/hooks/useWorkouts.ts
import { useQuery } from '@tanstack/react-query';
import { workoutQueries } from '@strength-design/shared/api';
```

### UI/UX Consistency

#### Design Token Sharing
```typescript
// packages/shared/design/tokens.ts
export const colors = {
  primary: {
    DEFAULT: "#FF6B35",
    light: "#FF8F5A",
    dark: "#E55A2B",
  },
  // ... rest of color system
};

// Web: Used directly in Tailwind config
// Mobile: Used in NativeWind config
```

#### Component Parity
- Maintain identical information architecture
- Use same iconography (Lucide React Native)
- Consistent navigation patterns
- Matching animation timings
- Identical form validation
